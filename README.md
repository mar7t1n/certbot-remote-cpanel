# certbot-remote-cpanel
Remotely commission SSL for cPanel where your hosting hasn't and won't install the Lets Encrypt plugin.

My hosting company is [TSOHost.com](https://www.tsohost.com/), the cPanel doesn't provide any plugin to manage SSL although you can do it manually. For a single domain it's easy enough. But it's a faff when you manage several, but when it saves you Â£50+ per domain then it's worth the hassle.

These scripts help automate the process for you, and can be extended and adjusted for your own needs. You can schedule them with cron, or diary a reminder to run. This process uses the cPanel API to upload the http challenge file, and install the certificate. In my instance there's no FileMan option available to delete.

The process can be run on another server where you have root access of which the easiest to comission is WSL.

Prerequisite - you will need **certbot**

```
sudo apt install certbot
```

Generate an API key within your cPanel - you'll need your account username and the API key, server and domain name in a config file as follows:

```
DOMAIN="example.com"
HOST="cpanel.hostingcompany.com"
APIUSR="username"
APIKEY="12345678901234567890"
```

Install and run the scripts (you can add --test-cert to the certbot command while you check things out and get it working properly otherwise Lets Encrypt will block you trying too many times) 

```
./generate-cert.sh env.config
```
